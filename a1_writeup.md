# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?
It was very confusing, I haven't taken another computer science class so I was very lost for the majority of the time I spent on this. But little by little I began to learn more and navigate how to use python. I belive I became the most comfortale with conditionals.

2. **How did you use AI effectively?** When entering my prompts, I always added that I was new to programming, in order to be able to get a simple and straighforward answer. Additionally, when I did not understand why my porgramming was not working, I put it into the AI and found out what misakes I made and how I could fix them. I used this specifically which my last problem when I was confused why my conditionals were not working.

3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?
As I have said before, all of this is brand new to me, I asked AI this prompt: "You are a programming tutor. Explain all of these concept and how to do them step by step to a high school student that is completely new to programming." I think the concept that was the most challenging was my first attempt at doing conditinals. As I states before, I put it into AI and it corrected me on the way that I was phrasing the code to make it better.
4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?
I often asked for examples of the problem, then comparing it to my own and making sure I followed the same steps to get to my own solution.
